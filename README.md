# Work Location Tracker

For hybrid workers who need to be in the office a minimum number of times each week.
This is a simple method to log your location, office or remote, each day.
You can also add days that were missed or revise a day if the wrong location was recorded.
The data is stored in a SQLite database, which simplifies the reporting.

The goal of this project was to make a GUI app that only used native python functionality.
There are no packages imported from other repositories.
